# BlockFlex v1.0

BlockFlex is out learning-based storage harvesting framework, which can harvest flash-based storage resources at fine-grained granularity in modern clould platforms.

## 1. Overview
```shell
# TODO FIXME 
export PARACRASH_PATH=$HOME/ParaCrash
```

## 2. Trace Analysis
Figure 1:
We use the Alibaba Cloud Traces [1] for Figure 1. 
Since the traces are quite large, to test, you can download a subset we use here:(TODO LINK)
Then run 
```shell
python3 container_parser.py && python3 ali_container_usage.py
python3 machine_parser.py && python3 ali_machine_usage.py
```
This will create Figures 1a and 1b.
